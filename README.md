# Operational Performance Audit: A Longitudinal Data Study
**Authored by Lauren | MS in Data Science, Boston University**

## 🎯 Project Objective
This dashboard serves as a "Subject Matter Expert" audit of 561 professional tasks executed between 2018 and 2026. The goal is to quantify operational reliability and client satisfaction through a verified, timestamped dataset.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Framework:** Streamlit (Python)
- **Visualization:** Altair (Declarative Statistical Visualization)
- **Data Pipeline:** Custom Regex-based CSV parsing and longitudinal retention analysis.

## ♿ Accessibility (A11y) & Inclusive Design
This project was built with a "Privacy & Inclusion First" mindset:
- **Screen Reader Optimized:** Implemented WAI-ARIA labels and semantic HTML landmarks for 100% blind-user compatibility.
- **Cognitive UX:** High-contrast typography (Figtree) and color-blind friendly palettes (Indigo/Slate).
- **System Messaging:** Strategic isolation of null values to prevent data leakage and maintain "Sure Bet" hiring signals.

## 🌿 Green AI & Sustainability
Consistent with my commitment to environmental accountability, this app is optimized for low-compute deployment, reducing the energy footprint of each session.
